===================
hipMAGMA README FILE
===================

This readme is specifically for building MAGMA with HIP/ROCm


This is intended for use on a HIP-enabled system. To check whether your system is compatible, make sure the HIP development libraries are installed (most of the time, this is in /opt/rocm). Ensure you have `hipcc` available

# Build Instructions

  1. Starting with a clone of the MAGMA source code (either from the bitbucket URL above, or from a release .zip/tarball), `cd magma` (or whatever the name of the repository is)

  2. Create a `make.inc` from one of the examples. For instance, the one I have been using during development is `make.inc.hip-gcc-openblas`, so, for example, run: `cp make.inc.hip-gcc-openblas make.inc`. For MKL-based builds, you can use `make.inc.hip-gcc-mkl`

  3. Export environment variables. For example, the computer hipMAGMA has been developed on (ICL's `caffeine` machine) has openblas installed in `/nfs/apps/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos7-x86_64/gcc-7.2.0/openblas-0.2.20-rnb5trk6z6o767ontlvlrjviswap2wxu`, so I would run the following command:
       * `export OPENBLASDIR=/nfs/apps/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos7-x86_64/gcc-7.2.0/openblas-0.2.20-rnb5trk6z6o767on1tlvlrjviswap2wxu`

  4. Once that command has been ran successfully, you can `make` MAGMA as normal. Here are common targets:
       * `make lib -j32` (builds the shared lib using 32 cores)
       * `make testing/testing_dgemm` (builds the dgemm tester)
       * `make sparse -j32` (builds the sparse library, this does not work sometimes due to varying hipSPARSE versions)

So, to build the library and a tester, run :
  * `make testing/testing_dgemm -j16 && ./testin/testing_dgemm`

# Known Problems

## OpenMP support

In general, HIP frontend (clang) support for OpenMP is iffy, `-fopenmp` has not always worked well. Sometimes, in `make.inc` we had to include `FOPENMP     = -fopenmp -L$(HIPDIR)/../aomp/lib -I$(HIPDIR)/../aomp/include`

## `sparse` library / hipSPARSE support

In general, the sparse library on the HIP backend does not work right now. We aren't sure what the solution is yet, but for now you cannot build it.

So, don't run `make sparse` or `make all`. You should use `make lib`, and `make test`.

## `libhip_hcc.so not found`
Sometimes, you get a list of errors like

```
/usr/bin/ld: warning: libhip_hcc.so, needed by /opt/rocm/lib/libhipblas.so, not found (try using -rpath or -rpath-link)
./lib/libmagma.so: undefined reference to `hipModuleLaunchKernel'
./lib/libmagma.so: undefined reference to `hipStreamSynchronize'
./lib/libmagma.so: undefined reference to `hipRuntimeGetVersion'
./lib/libmagma.so: undefined reference to `hipStreamDestroy'
./lib/libmagma.so: undefined reference to `hipGetLastError'
./lib/libmagma.so: undefined reference to `hip_impl::program_state::kernel_descriptor(unsigned long, hsa_agent_s)'
... (+100 lines)
```

To fix this, you need to include the `HIP` libraries on your dynamic loader path:

`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/rocm/hip/lib`

## Performance

For some reason, `dgemm` has poor performance on our test machines. `zgemm` somehow has better performance, which makes no sense. I'm still looking in to this.

## Unimplemented Functions

Many HIP functions have not been exported, so magma prints an error and treats it as a NOOP. A list of these functions can be found in `include/magma_types.h` around line 180. Or, you can grep for `magma_unsupported`, which is the macro used to mark functions as unsupported.

The function `*getrf_batched_smallsq_noshfl` has many of its sizes ommitted, due to an internal compiler bug. See the file `magmablas/zgetrf_batched_smallsq_noshfl.cu` for comments explaining this. Currently, it prints a message to stderr, and does not perform the computation
